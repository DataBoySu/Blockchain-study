## Majority is Not Enough (Eyal & Sirer, 2014)

- Mining power is modeled as a fraction α of total hash power.
- Block discovery follows a Poisson process.
- Network propagation is not instantaneous; temporary forks can exist.
- Honest miners follow the longest-chain rule without strategic behavior.
- Colluding miners can coordinate perfectly.

- Empirical evidence shows that Bitcoin miners behave strategically and form
pools.
- Paper assumes colluding mining pools have yet (2014), followed protocols.
- Paper comes to a conclusion, that the "selfish mining" can be applied to any global log blockchain network.
