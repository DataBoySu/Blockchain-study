## Selfish Mining Mechanism

- Selfish miners withhold newly mined blocks instead of publishing immediately.
- This creates a private chain that can be released strategically.
- When honest miners discover a competing block, selfish miners may release their private chain to invalidate honest work.
- Tie-breaking behavior of honest miners affects selfish miner revenue.
- This mechanism allows a minority coalition to earn disproportionate rewards.
