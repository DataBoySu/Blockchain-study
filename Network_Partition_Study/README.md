# Impact of Network Partition Attacks on Blockchain Consensus

This repository contains a small-scale simulation study for investigating the effect of network partition attacks on blockchain consensus stability.

The project consists of:

- A discrete-time simulator modeling block propagation under network partitions.
- Experimental evaluation of fork rates, orphaned blocks, and reorganization behavior.
- A technical report describing the model, experiments, and results.

This is an academic simulation project, not intended to be a production blockchain implementation.
