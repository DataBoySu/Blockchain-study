# CAP Theorem

- Consistency: All nodes have a consistent view of the data irrespective of where the client is connected to
- Availability: Ability to respond to requests from users at all time
- Partition Tolerance: Ability of system to continue operating even under a <b>network partition<b>

IF. a system suffers from network attack, it can prioritize either:

1. Availability but forgoes Consistency 
2. Consistency but forgoes Availability

However, CAP theorem assumes ideal state of network and simple model of Consistency and Availability which is rare, no, never seen in real-world networks.
